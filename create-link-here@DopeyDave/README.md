Create a Link Here
========================

Description
-----------

This Action adds the ability to create a link "here" (in the same folder) for a file or folder. The link is created using the .desktop file type, which allows for proper path tracking and display on the Desktop (if the shortcut happens to be moved there).

The behavior is similar to the Windows "create a shortcut" / "send to desktop" functionality.

This following Actions should be paired for a complete package:
* create-link-desktop@DopeyDave
* create-link-here@DopeyDave    (You Are Here)
* follow-desktop-link@DopeyDave

Usage
-----------

Right click on a file or folder. Select the new option "Create Link Here".
