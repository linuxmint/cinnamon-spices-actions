RELOAD ALL DESKLETS
===================

Reload all enabled desklets in Cinnamon.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This action will reload all desklets that are enabled on the Cinnamon desktop.
The need to do this can arise from situations that may cause desklets to
freeze such as resuming from standby/hibernation, stuck desklets, or even the
occasional disappearing desklet.

COMPATIBILITY
-------------

Due to the nature of Actions, this will only be guaranteed to be compatible up
to the latest versions of Cinnamon. Earlier versions of Cinnamon will be
supported on a best efforts basis.

As of now, this Action supports Cinnamon 5.4+.
