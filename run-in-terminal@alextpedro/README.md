# Run in Terminal Cinnamon Action

Right-click a .sh file and run in terminal, spawning a new terminal window which immediately runs your script. 

## Installing / Getting started

From Cinnamon Spices Website:
1. Download the zip file from the top right
2. Uncompress it into ~/.local/share/nemo/actions

From Cinnamon Actions settings menu: 
1. Go to the Download tab
2. Search "run in terminal" without quotes
3. Click the install button (downward-pointing arrow)

From GitHub:
1. Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/alextpedro/cinnamon-spices-actions/releases)
2. Download the latest release zip file
3. Uncompress it into ~/.local/share/nemo/actions

When you right-click a .sh script file you should have a new menu action, Run in Terminal.

## Features

It runs a script file in a new terminal window. Because I am lazy that way.

Special thanks to all other Actions developers, it was much easier to see what you all did than parse through the sample file <3
