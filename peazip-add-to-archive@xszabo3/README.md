# Add to archive action for the Flatpak version of PeaZip

Adds **Add to archive** action to the context menu (right-click menu) for the Nemo file manager. Actions make zipping and unzipping zip (and other) files more convenient.

## Prerequisites

Install the Flatpak version of PeaZip from the Software Manager.

**Important** - These files require the Flatpak version, they will not work if you installed the .deb package from the PeaZip website.

1. To download the action either:

    - Download the action through the **Actions** window from the **Download** tab. (Recommended)

        - Unpack the downloaded zip
        - Paste the contents to the **~/.local/share/nemo/actions** folder
