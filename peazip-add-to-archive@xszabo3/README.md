# Add to archive action for the Flatpak version of PeaZip

Adds **Add to archive** action to the context menu (right-click menu) for the Nemo file manager. Actions make zipping and unzipping zip (and other) files more convenient.

## Prerequisites

Install the Flatpak version of PeaZip from the Software Manager.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These files require the Flatpak version, they will not work if you installed the .deb package from the PeaZip website.

### How to group actions

This feature is available from Linux Mint **22**.
